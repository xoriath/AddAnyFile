You can either click that button or use the keybord shortcut **Alt+F2**.

### Create folders

Create additional folders for your file by using forward-slash to
specify the structure.

For example, by typing **scripts/test.js** in the dialog, the
folder **scripts** is created if it doesn't exist and the file
**test.js** is then placed into it.
